Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze Uber rides data to gain insights into user behavior, driver patterns, and areas of high demand. We will use Python along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for the analysis.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains details of Uber rides, including start and end times, ride categories, start and stop locations, mileage, and ride purposes.

Data Preparation and Cleaning:

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Convert date columns (START_DATE and END_DATE) to datetime objects.
Handle missing values in the PURPOSE column.
Extract additional features such as ride duration from the date columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary statistics of the dataset.
Distribution of ride categories.
Most common start and stop locations.
Analysis of ride purposes.
Distribution of ride distances.
Analysis of ride times and durations.
Data Visualization:

Bar charts for categorical data (e.g., ride categories, purposes).
Histograms for numerical data (e.g., ride distances).
Time series plots for ride counts over time.
Geographical plots to show popular start and stop locations.
Pattern Analysis:

Identify peak hours and days for Uber rides.
Analyze the relationship between ride distance and duration.
Determine the most frequent routes.
User and Driver Behavior Analysis:

Analyze the frequency of rides per user.
Determine the average rating per user (if available).
Study patterns in driver activity (if driver data is available).
Additional Analysis:

Monthly trends and seasonality.
Analysis of ride frequency based on weather conditions (if weather data is available).
Correlation analysis between different variables.
Predictive modeling to forecast ride demand.
Conclusion:
By following the above steps, we can gain valuable insights into the patterns and behaviors in the Uber rides data. This analysis can help improve business strategies, optimize ride services, and enhance user experience. Additionally, predictive modeling can assist in forecasting ride demand, which can be crucial for resource allocation and planning.
